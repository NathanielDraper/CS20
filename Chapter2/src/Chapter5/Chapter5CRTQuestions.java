		// 1.) The Purpose of a Loop Structure is to execute a command repeatedly 
		
		// 2.) A While loop evaluates the statement before it runs while a Do-while loop evaluates the statement after the first execution
		
		// 3.) The guessing game exercise had input validation

		// 4.) An infinite loop is a loop that will execute commands without ever stoppping
		
		// 4.) b.) A system that is always set to true and a program that never has a stop function may cause an infinite loop
		
		// 4.) c.) An oveflow is a value assigned that is out of any range set by the program
		
		// 5.) The Do while loop will execute 60 times 
		
		// 6.) The value is negative so it would never stop 
		
		// 7.) A counter can count numbers going up such as 1 2 3 4 5 6, an accumulator can do more complex material such as add digits
		
		// 8.) int ones = (num / 1) % 10;
		// int tens = (num /10) % 10; // Adds all of the digits
		// int hundreths = (num /100) %10;
		
	     //int digitsSum = tens + ones + hundreths; // Adds
		
		 // 9.) If you want a loop to start doing things before it starts running use a while loop but if you want to let the loop run once then start executing commadns use a Do loop
		
		// 10.) To debug an application in Eclipse you can use the inspect and watch method which will display a the value of the entire code
		// There is also a method in Java called Drop to frame which allows you run individual pieces of code to test for bugs within the entire application
